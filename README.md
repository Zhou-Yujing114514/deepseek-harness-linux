# DeepSeek Harness

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com).

It is built on an **everything-is-a-plugin** architecture and powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512).

Documentation: [https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/)

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is in _developer preview_ and iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

Review the [safety notice](SAFETY.md) before running the project.

## Run

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens it in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run from a repository checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```

`pnpm run build` prepares the repository artifacts. `pnpm dsh web` uses those built artifacts without rebuilding.

### Desktop on Linux

The Desktop application can be packaged for Linux on an Ubuntu 24.04 (or compatible) host, for both architectures and three install formats each (AppImage, Debian `.deb`, portable `.tar.gz`):

```sh
pnpm install
cp apps/desktop/.env.linux.example apps/desktop/.env.linux   # then fill in the release settings
pnpm --dir apps/desktop run package:linux:x64                # x64 (AMD/Intel): AppImage + deb + tar.gz
pnpm --dir apps/desktop run package:linux:arm64              # ARM64: AppImage + deb + tar.gz
```

Electron-builder needs FUSE 2 (`libfuse2`) on the build host to assemble an AppImage; `.deb` packaging requires a maintainer, which the Linux configuration already sets. Linux builds are unsigned: auto-update goes through the AppImage channel (electron-updater) with HTTPS and the `nightly-linux.yml` feed but no code-signature verification, so for distribution to third parties this is the supply-chain point to assess. `.deb` and `.tar.gz` are versioned installers published alongside it. The `Desktop (Linux)` workflow builds both architectures on native runners on demand. See [the Desktop packaging notes](apps/desktop/README.md) for release versions, uploads, and per-target environment files.

## Community and support

- Submit feedback or bug reports through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions).
- Add the [`dsh-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) topic to your plugin repository for discoverability.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

Start with the [development guide](docs/development.md) and [architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md).

`pnpm run dev:web` builds, serves, and rebuilds client bundles on source edits in one terminal, and `make help` lists the matching Make targets for Web and Desktop; the guide's application commands section owns the full table.
